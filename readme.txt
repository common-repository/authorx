Multiple Authors (Co-Authors) for Posts in WordPress

== Description ==
Many websites often have multiple authors working on the same article. For example, on news websites sometimes multiple journalists contribute to a single story. In that case you may want to give credit to all the authors who worked on the post. The AuthorX plugin will allow multiple authors to be associated with a post in WordPress.
